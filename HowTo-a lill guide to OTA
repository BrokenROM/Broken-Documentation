This guide will help you add OTA functionality to your Broken build. 

We need two files, ota-lollipop.xml and ota_conf

Use the templates for ota_lollipop.xml and ota_conf, i will paste mine below in here

Create a folder for your Broken builds ether on AFH or on the website. The folder link will be used in the ota files.
Keep in mind that when using afh, the download button will open the browser on the afh paga, i don't wan't that
So i will be using validusrom.com and make them download immediately.

You need to add &amp; to your androidfilehost folder link. 

For example, if your folder link is  <RomUrl>https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=34631</RomUrl>

Add a &amp; after the word files. So, using the above example, this is what you input in rom url:

                                     <RomUrl>https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&amp;flid=34631</RomUrl>

For the device name, open terminal and type in getprop ro.broken.device. Use this name in ota_lollipop.xml in the mentioned place.

Now, you need to upload to a hosting site with hotlinking support. We use Dropbox. Upload this xml file to dropbox (not in the public folder). If your link ends with a zero, change it to one.

For example, if your link is https://www.dropbox.com/s/tkgmb54b2dhjxhz/ota_lollipop.xml?dl=0, change it to https://www.dropbox.com/s/tkgmb54b2dhjxhz/ota_lollipop.xml?dl=1
This automatically downloads the file. 

We do not want this link to change when the xml file is edited. To do this, install dropbox in your pc, and sync the dropbox folder. Now you can edit the file locally, and it'll sync, without changing the link.

This is what my ota-lollipop.xml looks like
Where it says bacon you need to enter your device name! duh?
So if you build multiple devices you can add them all in on xml, capice?

Now, moving to the ota_conf, you need to make this file in your Broken project's root folder. SlimOTA's makefile will automatically take it to the desired location. 
Use the command "touch ota_conf" in your root folder to create the file, and edit it. Use the template for ota_conf that i will paste here below for your convenience.
You need to Change the url to the one where you dropped your ota-lollipop (i hope it still clear upto now)

  Look here:(copie pastie stuff)

#Add the url where you have uploaded the xml [ upload it to dropbox since it supports hot linking. keep dl=1 at the end of the link ]
#ro.product.device will get the name of the device. Use the same name in ota-lollipop.xml in the tag
ota_url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/l9s7pb0ldaw9axz/ota-lollipop.xml?dl=1
release_type=OFFICIAL
device_name=ro.product.device
 
# example ro.broken.version=Broken-v3.3-bacon-5.1.1-OFFICIAL-20150827.zip
# We have to get the date position out of that, so position 4 (i think) since the delimiter is set to -
version_source=ro.broken.version
version_delimiter=-
version_position=5
version_format=yyyyMMdd

  All you have to do here is change ota_url to your dropbox location

That's about it! Whenever you release a new build, just update the filename in ota_lollipop.xml. Nothing else needs to be updated.
